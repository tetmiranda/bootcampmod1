# Title

## Overview and Origin

### What is the name of the company? 
  * Zai is the official brand name of the company (https://www.hellozai.com/)
  * Prior to Zai, the company was a merged from the Assembly Payment (as PromisePay) and CurrencyFair (https://blog.hellozai.com/zai-merger-creates-a-new-force-in-australian-financial-services). 
  * Both Assembly Payments and CurrencyFair were founded by Australian innovators

### When was the company incorporated?
  * Before Zai, CurrencyFair became the first official name of the Company which was on April 2009

### Who are the founders of the company? The company was found by the following co-founders of CurrencyFair.
  * Brett Meyers
  * Jonathan Potter
  * Sean Barrett
  * David Christian
  
  *They all have Software Engineering background and experience in the banking sector.*

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
  * The idea came about when Brett Meyers, who was then an expat living in Ireland often sends money to Australia. The banks charged an upfront fee but when then he realised that the margin the banks were building into the exchange rate was usually north of 3% and Australian banks would usually charge about 5%. Brett started to think, that's not really very fair. In his mind, that there must be a better way to do this
  * With this experience he and his co-founders have thought about solving the problem of expensive and inconvenient money transfers and currency exchange

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? 
  * Here's another short story of how the company was being funded. By 2009 Myers, a software engineer in the banking sector, had become an Irish citizen and spent much of that year talking to business support agencies and would-be investors while his colleagues worked in their spare time turning their shared vision into a viable venture.
  * The early years. Fast-forward to April 2010 and the CurrencyFair platform was launched as a peer-to-peer currency exchange with six staff. The mission was not just to provide lower-cost foreign currency transactions, traditionally done at a higher cost by banks, but to also simplify and accelerate the process for consumers.

  * Just over one year later in July 2011, CurrencyFair completed its fourth funding round for €670,000, raised through a combination of angel investors and the Irish government’s development and growth agency Enterprise Ireland, to add to the €980,000 already acquired. The company had, by now, helped customers save €1 million.

* They raised €400,000 in that first round of fundraising and by April of that same year CurrencyFair was officially born, with two of the co-founders able to go full-time on the project by July.
